# Looker Extension Example using React

This repository serves as an example for creating a new Looker Extension using React.

It uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org) for writing your extension, the [React Extension SDK]((https://github.com/looker-open-source/sdk-codegen/tree/main/packages/extension-sdk-react) for interacting with Looker, [Looker Components](https://components.looker.com) for UI, and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for building your code.

## Getting Started for Development

1. Clone or download a copy of the containing repository to your development machine.

   ```
   # cd ~/ Optional. your user directory is usually a good place to git clone to.
   git clone git@github.com:looker-open-source/extension-examples.git
   ```

2. Navigate (`cd`) to the template directory on your system

   ```
   cd extension-examples/react/typescript/looks-query
   ```

3. Install the dependencies with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

   ```
   yarn install
   ```

   > You may need to update your Node version or use a [Node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to change your Node version.

4. Start the development server

   ```
   yarn develop
   ```

   Great! Your extension is now running and serving the JavaScript at http://localhost:8080/bundle.js.

5. Now log in to Looker and create a new project.

   This is found under **Develop** => **Manage LookML Projects** => **New LookML Project**.

   You'll want to select "Blank Project" as your "Starting Point". You'll now have a new project with no files.

   1. In your copy of the extension project you have a `manifest.lkml` file.

   You can either drag & upload this file into your Looker project, or create a `manifest.lkml` with the same content. Change the `id`, `label`, or `url` as needed.

   ```
   application: look-runner {
    label: "Look Runner"
    url: "http://localhost:8080/bundle.js"
    entitlements: {
      core_api_methods: ["run_inline_query", "me", "all_looks", "run_look"]
    }
   }
   ```

6. Create a `model` LookML file in your project. The name doesn't matter. The model and connection won't be used, and in the future this step may be eliminated.

   - Add a connection in this model. It can be any connection, it doesn't matter which.
   - [Configure the model you created](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/getting-started/create-projects#configuring_a_model) so that it has access to some connection.

7. Connect your new project to Git. You can do this multiple ways:

   - Create a new repository on GitHub or a similar service, and follow the instructions to [connect your project to Git](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/getting-started/setting-up-git-connection)
   - A simpler but less powerful approach is to set up git with the "Bare" repository option which does not require connecting to an external Git Service.

8. Commit your changes and deploy your them to production through the Project UI.

9. Reload the page and click the `Browse` dropdown menu. You should see your extension in the list.
   - The extension will load the JavaScript from the `url` provided in the `application` definition. By default, this is http://localhost:8080/bundle.js. If you change the port your server runs on in the package.json, you will need to also update it in the manifest.lkml.

- Refreshing the extension page will bring in any new code changes from the extension template, although some changes will hot reload.

## Deployment

The process above requires your local development server to be running to load the extension code. To allow other people to use the extension, we can build the JavaScript file and include it in the project directly.

1. In your extension project directory on your development machine you can build the extension with `yarn build`.
2. Drag and drop the generated `dist/bundle.js` file into the Looker project interface
3. Modify your `manifest.lkml` to use `file` instead of `url`:

   ```
   application: look-runner {
   label: "Look Runner"
   url: "http://localhost:8080/bundle.js"
   entitlements: {
     core_api_methods: ["run_inline_query", "me", "all_looks", "run_look"]
   }
   }
   ```

## Notes

- This template uses Looker's [component library](https://components.looker.com) and [styled components](https://styled-components.com/). Neither of these libraries are required, and you may remove and replace them with a component library of your own choice or simply build your UI from scratch.
