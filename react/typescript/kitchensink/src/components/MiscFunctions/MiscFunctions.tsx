            Clicking the button below will cause the extension to try and
            navigate to a new location within the extension window (not the
            owning window for which there is an extension SDK method). This is
            not allowed (extensions MUST be single page applications). The
            extension will be reloaded if the window location does change.

          <Paragraph>
            A circuit breaker has been built into the extension reload
            functionality. Should an extension attempt to change location more
            than 3 times in a 30 second window, the extension will NOT be
            reloaded and an error message will be displayed. You can simulate
            this by pressing the button 4 times within the 30 second window (you
            have to wait for the extension to reload).

            The extension framework prevents you from opening windows directly.
            Clicking the button below attempts to this and should fail.
