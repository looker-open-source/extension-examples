a sandboxed iframe, it is not allowed to directly use the parents \`window.location\` to navigate
to a different page or to open a new browser window. The extensionSDK provides APIs to allow you to this
but permission to do so must be requested through entitlements.

- The \`navigation\` entitlement must be set to change the location of the current window.
- The \`new_window\` entitlement must be set to open a new window in the current Looker instance.
- The \`new_window_external_urls\` entitlement must be set to open a new window at a server other
than the current Looker server
